# Live2Motion Photos

A web UI for converting iPhone Live Photos into Google / Samsung Motion Photos, so they animate natively in Google Photos on Android. Works two ways: run it **locally** on your own Windows, macOS, or Linux machine and use it entirely by yourself (open `http://localhost:7000` in a browser on that same computer — nothing else required), or **self-host** it on a home server so it's reachable from any device on your network. Same app either way; see [Installation](#installation) for both.

Built as a browser-based frontend around [MotionPhoto2](https://github.com/PetrVys/MotionPhoto2) by PetrVys, adding a real-time progress dashboard, folder browser, scheduled runs, and file-watcher automation.

MotionPhoto2's source is vendored in `MotionPhoto2/` (pinned to upstream commit `5848f9b`) and run directly via `python3` — there is no compiled binary to build or download. This repo carries one small patch on top of upstream: a missing paired file (e.g. an image whose video got deleted, or a duplicate `ContentIdentifier` collision) is logged and skipped instead of calling `sys.exit(1)` and killing the whole batch. See `MotionPhoto2/Muxer.py` (`MuxerInputError`) and `MotionPhoto2/motionphoto2.py` (`failed_pairs`) for the diff from upstream.

## Why

When you transfer iPhone Live Photos to Android or a PC, they split into two separate files — a still image (`.HEIC` / `.JPEG`) and a short video clip (`.MOV`). Google Photos on Android does not automatically recognise these as a pair and will not animate them.

Live2Motion wraps MotionPhoto2 to mux each pair into a single Google Motion Photo file (`.LIVE.HEIC` or in-place overwrite), which Google Photos recognises and animates exactly as Apple's Live Photos do on iPhone.

## Features

- **Browser UI** — works purely on your own machine (`localhost:7000`) for solo local use, or accessible from any device on your network if self-hosted; no app to install on your phone either way
- **Real-time progress** — live terminal output with per-file status, colour-coded warnings and errors
- **Statistics panel** — donut chart showing Completed / Skipped / Errors / Remaining with live updates
- **Folder browser** — point-and-click navigation of the server filesystem to select input/output directories
- **All MotionPhoto2 settings** exposed with hover tooltips explaining each option
- **Scheduled runs** — built-in cron scheduler with presets (hourly, daily, weekly) or custom cron expressions
- **File watcher** — monitors the input directory and auto-triggers a run when new media arrives, with configurable debounce delay
- **Run history** — last 20 runs with trigger type, duration, converted/skipped/error counts, and exit status
- **Persistent settings** — configuration saved to `config.json` and restored on restart
- **Systemd service** — runs in the background and starts on boot

## Requirements

- Linux, macOS, or Windows (tested natively on Debian 13 and macOS; Windows works but is less battle-tested — Docker is the more proven path there, see below)
- Python 3.9+ (native install only — not needed for Docker)
- [ExifTool](https://exiftool.org/) (`sudo apt install libimage-exiftool-perl` on Linux, `brew install exiftool` on macOS, [exiftool.org](https://exiftool.org/) build on Windows — native install only, not needed for Docker)

The web UI itself is just a browser page — once the server (native or Docker) is running anywhere on your network, you open it from **any** device's browser, Windows included, with nothing to install on the client side.

---

## Installation

Two ways to run it: **Docker** (no Python/ExifTool install needed, identical on every OS — recommended for Windows and macOS) or **native** (recommended for Linux, e.g. as a systemd service on a homelab server).

### Option A: Docker (Linux, macOS, Windows)

Requires [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (Docker Desktop on macOS/Windows, Docker Engine on Linux).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ramin-azizi/Live2MotionPhotos.git
cd Live2MotionPhotos
cp config.example.json config.json
```

Edit `docker-compose.yml` and point the second volume at your photo library:

```yaml
volumes:
  - ./config.json:/app/config.json
  - /path/to/your/photos:/data      # ← change the left side to your actual photo folder
```

Then in `config.json`, set `"input_directory": "/data"` (that's the path *inside* the container that maps to the folder you mounted — you can also just pick it via the in-app folder browser after starting).

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

Open **http://your-machine-ip:7000**. To update after pulling new code: `docker compose up -d --build`.

### Option B: Native (Linux / macOS / Windows)

#### 1. Install ExifTool

```bash
sudo apt install libimage-exiftool-perl   # Linux
brew install exiftool                     # macOS
```
On Windows, download the ExifTool executable from [exiftool.org](https://exiftool.org/), rename it to `exiftool.exe`, and put it somewhere on your `PATH`.

#### 2. Clone and install Live2Motion

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ramin-azizi/Live2MotionPhotos.git
cd Live2MotionPhotos
python3 -m venv venv
venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt      # Windows: venv\Scripts\pip install -r requirements.txt
cp config.example.json config.json            # Windows: copy config.example.json config.json
```

This installs both the web app's dependencies and MotionPhoto2's (the vendored `MotionPhoto2/` folder is run directly as a subprocess — no separate download or build step).

#### 3. Run

```bash
venv/bin/python app.py      # Windows: venv\Scripts\python app.py
```

Then open **http://your-server-ip:7000** in a browser (port 7000 may already be taken by macOS Control Center on a Mac — use a different port for local dev, see below).

### Local development on a machine other than the homelab server

You don't need the server or its photo library to work on the FastAPI routes / UI. Run it on any free port:

```bash
venv/bin/python3 -c "
import uvicorn, app
uvicorn.run(app.app, host='127.0.0.1', port=7099)
"
```

To point at a different (or fake) photo library, edit `input_directory` in `config.json`. To use a pre-built binary instead of the vendored source (e.g. for speed), set `MOTIONPHOTO2_BIN=/path/to/binary` in the environment before starting.

---

## Running as a systemd service (auto-start on boot, Linux only)

For Docker on any OS, `restart: unless-stopped` in `docker-compose.yml` already handles auto-start/restart — no separate service setup needed. On Windows running natively, use Task Scheduler (run `app.py` "at log on", or as a service via [NSSM](https://nssm.cc/)) instead of the systemd unit below.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/live2motion.service
```

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Live2Motion Photos Web UI
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=youruser
WorkingDirectory=/path/to/Live2MotionPhotos
ExecStart=/path/to/Live2MotionPhotos/venv/bin/python app.py
Restart=always
RestartSec=5

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now live2motion
```

## Usage

### Settings

| Setting | Flag | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Input Directory | | Root folder containing your Live Photos |
| Output Directory | | Where to save results. Leave empty to use Overwrite mode |
| Recursive | `-r` | Scan all subdirectories |
| EXIF Match | `-em` | Match pairs by EXIF metadata instead of filename. Recommended for iPhone exports where filenames may not align |
| Incremental Mode | `-im` | Skip files already converted. Requires an Output Directory |
| Copy Unmuxed | `-cu` | Copy non-live photos unchanged to the Output Directory |
| Overwrite Originals | `-o` | Replace source images in place. No Output Directory needed |
| Delete Video After Mux | `-dv` | Remove the `.MOV` file after embedding it |
| Keep Temp Files | `-kt` | Retain temporary files for debugging |
| Skip XMP Metadata | `-nx` | Do not copy XMP tags to the output |
| Verbose | `-v` | Detailed per-file log output |

### Schedule

Enable **scheduled runs** and choose a preset (hourly / daily 2 AM / weekly Sunday 2 AM) or enter a custom [cron expression](https://crontab.guru/). The next scheduled run time is shown below the selector.

### File Watcher

Enable **auto-run on new files** to monitor the Input Directory for incoming `.HEIC`, `.JPEG`, `.MOV`, or `.MP4` files. After new files stop arriving for the configured **debounce period** (default 300 s), a conversion run is triggered automatically. Set the debounce higher than the time it takes to fully transfer a batch of photos from your iPhone.

## Limitations

### HDR in Google Photos

HDR is displayed correctly in Google Photos only for HEIC files with HDR stored in ISO/CD 21496-1 format — effectively requiring **iPhone 15+ shooting on iOS 18+**.

For photos from older devices (iPhone 14 and earlier, iPads, etc.), Google Photos will report the photo as non-HDR after upload. This is not accurate — the Apple HDR gain map is preserved in the file untouched by Live2Motion. If you save the photo back to iPhone Camera Roll, the native Photos app will render it as HDR. Google Photos on iPhone/iPad will also display it correctly, as the iOS app reads Apple's gain map directly, bypassing the server-side HDR flag.

The reason is that Google's server-side pipeline stops checking for HDR metadata once it encounters the GCamera XMP object (which Motion Photos require). This is a known limitation of MotionPhoto2 itself:

> *"It appears that the server-side processing of Google Photos does not check for Apple HDR or ISO HDR once it finds Google Camera header in XMP tags."*
> — [MotionPhoto2 README](https://github.com/PetrVys/MotionPhoto2/#limitations)

For JPG files a metadata-only fix is theoretically possible (adjusting the JPEG/R HDR fields without re-encoding). For HEIF files, converting Apple's gain map to ISO `tmap` format is non-trivial and not yet implemented in any open-source tool.

**In practice:** for family photo sharing viewed primarily on iPhones, the HDR is fully preserved and visible. The limitation only affects Android displays or Google Photos on the web.

### Skipped file detection

Skip detection parses the MotionPhoto2 log output for keywords (`skip`, `already`, `no matching`). It may undercount in edge cases where the tool silently skips a file without logging a recognisable message.

### Security

The web UI has no authentication and exposes a folder browser for the server filesystem. It is intended for **trusted local network use only**. Do not expose port 7000 to the internet.
